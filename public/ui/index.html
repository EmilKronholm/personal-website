            <p>
                I am a passionate and creative Computer Engineer specializing in software development and mobile platforms. 
                With years of experience in programming, I thrive in problem-solving and building efficient, well-structured applications. 
                My expertise spans across web, system, and game development, all of which require a keen eye for detail and innovation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I am studying at Jönköping Engineering School, where I balance academic excellence with hands-on experience. 
                As a lab assistant, I mentor students in programming, refining my leadership and communication skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                My interests include agile methodologies, software architecture, and statistics, which play a crucial role in my career aspirations. 
                I am always eager to learn new technologies and improve my ability to solve complex problems effectively.
