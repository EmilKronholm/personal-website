        <h2>Welcome to Emil Kronholm's personal website!</h2>
        <p>
          My personal goal is to become one of the best developer of my time.
          This goal is far from realistic and will (probably) never come true;
          but I think it keeps me learning, staying positive, and motives me to
          one day make a groundbreaking innovation! <br /><br />
          I hope you will enjoy you stay!
